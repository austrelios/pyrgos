                WHAT IS YOUR DEPOSIT POLICY?
                <br>
                A 25% nonrefundable deposit is required to confirm a booking.
                <br>
                WHAT ARE YOUR PAYMENT TERMS AND METHODS OF PAYMENT?
                <br>
                In order to reserve and confirm the booking, a 25% non-refundable deposit is required to confirm a

                You are able to pay by credit card or debit card. Please note, that VRBO has a "service fee" which we
                are unable to waive if you chose to book with directly using their credit card facility; however, we
                offer you the option to book with us directly, via our booking portal, should you wish to avoid online
                travel agency service fees.

                WHAT IS YOUR REFUND POLICY?

                Cancellations made after paying the deposit and prior to the due date for paying the balance of the
                rental, the deposit is forfeited in full and is non-refundable.
                Cancellations made after paying the deposit and balance of rental due that are made prior to the
                specified arrival date: 100% of the full booking price is forfeited and is non-refundable.
                Cancellation after your stay commences or early departure does not entitle you to any refund.
                If, in the unlikely event, we, the Owners, cancel your booking for reasons other than Force Majeure (as
                detailed in the booking contract), we will refund all monies already paid to us.
                Please ensure that you have adequate insurance in place to cover any such non-refundable cancellation
                eventualities.
